There's a dark mode which might be set by default - just toggle it with the moon-icon in the top right corner ðŸ˜Š

#### todo: (Sorry, don't have more time for this for now ðŸ™ƒ)
- animations with moti (didn't have time to go through the setup and haven't tried moti on the web yet. I do use it a lot on our app)
- refactoring and some ts fixes, I tried to move quickly so this surely isn't the cleanest code everywhere.
- set up a proper eslint/prettier config... sadly expo doesn't seem to provide this with expo init like react-native init does
- native feedback for buttons would be nicer than just TouchableOpacity
- here and there I might have been a bit scrappy regarding the design (not the same icons, spacings, etc.)
- I'd be much more thorough in a real application with more time to spend
- and so on ...


#### online web version:
I quickly deployed this project on [AWS Amplify](https://main.dy0w5i996ma4g.amplifyapp.com/)
